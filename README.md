Bill Split Calculator
This one would take in an overall bill, a tip percentage, and how many ways to split it, and calculates how much each party owes. For a really good version of this, you'd want to make the tip and how many ways to split it optional parameters, so they could easily just figure the tip on their solo meal, or split it some number of ways with a default tip percentage.
